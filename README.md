# Core Python Data Processing & Recommendation System

This project demonstrates how real-world data can be explored, cleaned, and
structured using only Python built-in modules (no pandas, NumPy, or external libraries).

The goal was to strengthen fundamentals of data handling and recommendation logic
before relying on high-level libraries.

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded and explored raw JSON data dumps
2. Displayed structured user and page information
3. Cleaned data by:
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicate friends and pages
   - Filtering inactive users
4. Built a "People You May Know" feature using mutual connections
5. Built a "Pages You Might Like" feature based on shared interests

## Data Structures & Logic Used
- Lists for sequential data storage
- Dictionaries (hash maps) for fast user and page lookups
- Sets for removing duplicates and computing intersections
- Scoring and sorting logic to rank recommendations

## Key Learnings
- How recommendation systems work at a logical level
- Importance of choosing the right data structure
- Building scalable logic before applying data science libraries

## Skills Used
Python, Data Structures, Data Cleaning, File Handling, Recommendation Logic
